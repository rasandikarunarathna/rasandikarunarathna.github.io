    <h2>Our Tea Experience</h2>
    <p>Tea is a product of its origin. Its authentic character is derived from its environs and climatic conditions, tracing back to how the tender leaves are picked and processed. Each and every phase the tea leaves go through build their unique characteristics distinctive to its origin giving it body, character, flavour and aroma.</p>
    <p>Tea Estates with years of expertise in regards to tea tasting in Sri Lanka have mastered their “tasting vocabulary” and have created over 500 blends to date to suit the palate of our consumers globally. The following guide has been developed by our Tea Masters along with connoisseurs, translating the language of tea in order to transform the traditional tea drinker into a tea taster.</p>

    <h2>The benefits of consuming tea</h2>
    <p>Tea is a refreshing drink and can be served hot or iced. At the very least, it’s a flavourful way of getting enough fluid into your body each day and studies have shown teas can help protect your teeth and your heart, as well as possibly even helping to stave off cancer.
        There is plenty of research* showing that drinking tea can improve your health.  Here are ten health benefits of tea:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tea contains antioxidants</li>
        <p>Antioxidants work to prevent the body’s version of rust and thus help to keep us young and protect us from damage from pollution.</p>
        <li>Tea contains less caffeine than coffee</li>
        <p>Herbal tea blends have no caffeine and traditional teas have less than 50 percent of what typically is found in coffee. This means you can drink it without as many effects on your nervous system according to nutritionists.</p>
        <li>Tea may reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke</li>
        <p>A recent study found a nearly 20 percent reduction in the risk of heart attack and a 35 percent reduced risk of stroke among those who drank one to three cups of green tea a day. Those who drank four or more cups of green tea daily had a 32 percent reduction in the risk of having a heart attack and lower levels of the bad cholesterol, LDL.</p>
        <li>Tea may help with weight loss</li>
        <p>Although research on this isn’t as strong, studies have shown an effect have depended on consumption of large amounts of tea, often in pill form.</p>
        <li>Tea may help protect your bones</li>
        <p>Data from recent animal studies has shown that green tea may prevent bone loss.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quality of Sri Lankan tea</h2>
    <p>The Sri Lankan Tea industry maintains the highest quality in the world market and ISO 3720 is the minimum standard applied for the products. The Country has the capability to produce the cleanest tea in the world in terms of minimum pesticides and residues. Methyl Bromide was removed from the production process in 2012. Therefore, Sri Lankan tea has been identified as an “ozone free tea” in the world trade. Sri Lanka is also adjusting well to the stringent ISO 22000 series and to the health & safety regulations stipulated by the European Community.</p>
    <p>Growers are constantly educated to practice Good Agricultural Practices (GAP). The Processing/ Manufacturing facilities owned by the export companies comply with local standards (SLSI) and with International Quality Standards such as ISO, HACCP, and EU Standards. Traceability throughout the supply chain is monitored in order to guarantee a safe product to the consumers.</p>
