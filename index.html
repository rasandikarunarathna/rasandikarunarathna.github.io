            <h1>Introduction About Ceylon Tea</h1></a>
                <p> Tea production is one of the main sources of foreign exchange for Sri Lanka, and accounts for 2% of GDP, contributing over US$1.3 billion in 2021 to the economy of Sri Lanka. It employs, directly or indirectly, over 1 million people, and in 1995 directly employed 215,338 on tea plantations and estates. In addition, tea planting by smallholders is the source of employment for thousands whilst it is also the main form of livelihoods for tens of thousands of families.</p><p> Sri Lanka is the world's fourth-largest producer of tea. In 1995, it was the world's leading exporter of tea (rather than producer), with 23% of the total world export, and Sri Lanka ranked second on tea export earnings in 2020 after China. The highest production of 340 million kg was recorded in 2013, while the production in 2014 was slightly reduced to 338 million kg.</p>

                <h2>History of Ceylon tea.</h2>
                    <p>Sri Lankan tea (known for generations as Ceylon Tea) carries behind it a heritage and success story like no other. The story of Ceylon tea begins over two hundred years ago, when the country was still a British colony. In 1824 a tea plant was brought to Ceylon by the British from China and was planted in the Royal Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya for non-commercial purposes.</p><p> Further experimental planting of tea had begun in 1839 with tea plants brought from Assam and Calcutta through the East India Company As Ceylon tea gained in popularity throughout the world, a need arose to mediate and monitor the sales of tea. The first public Colombo Auction was held at the premises of Somerville & Co. on 30 July, 1883, under the auspices of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.</p>

               <h2>Logo</h2>     
               <p>The Sri Lanka Tea Board is the legal proprietor of the lion logo of Ceylon tea. The logo has been registered as a trademark in many countries. In order to appear the Lion logo on a tea pack, it must meet four criteria.
                The logo is considered to be a "known sign of a high quality" around the world.<p> The Sri Lanka Tea board signed an agreement to sponsor Sri Lanka national cricket team and Sri Lanka women's national cricket team in their overseas tours for US$4 million for three years.
                There are a number of organizations, both international and local, those promotes and enforce sustainability standards and certifications pertaining to tea in Sri Lanka.</p>
                Among the international organizations that operate within Sri Lanka are Rainforest Alliance, Fair-trade, UTZ Certified and Ethical Tea Partnership. The Small Organic Farmers’ Association (SOFA) is a local organization dedicated to organic farming.

            <h2>Types of tea that you can try in Sri Lanka</h2>
                <p>Sri Lankans drink black tea very strong with milk and sugar. Sharing a pot in the afternoon is a common way to wind down from a busy day. The tea of choice in most households is the strong black tea, commonly called “CeylonTea”. Depending on where the plants grow, the flavor will be different. This is why the tea in Sri Lanka is so special.</p>
                    <p>There are four basic kinds of tea that can be manufactured from the Camellia Sinensis plant. All sorts of tea come from the same kind of plant, but it is the soil and weather that give each plant a different flavor. There are five areas in Sri Lanka where tea grows, each at a different elevation. Each area produces a slightly different-tasting tea.</p>

            <h3><li>Black Tea</li></h3>
                <p>Black tea is the most common kind of tea. Ceylon black tea is considered the cleanest tea in the world, free of harmful pesticides or additives.Black tea, also translated to red tea in various East Asian languages, is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, yellow, white and green teas. </p><p> tea is generally stronger in flavour than other teas. All five types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis, though Camellia taliensis is also rarely used.</p>

            <h3><li>Green Tea</li></h3>
                <p>Ceylon green tea is quickly gaining traction outside of Sri Lanka. The process of making green tea is different to black tea, even though it comes from the same kind of plant. The leaves are unfermented, maintaining their antioxidant attributes. The leaves are picked, withered and heated, then rolled before drying and sifting.</p><p> Ceylon green tea is pure and clean, just like the black tea. Here are some of the varieties of green tea that you can try in Sri Lanka:</p>

        <h3><li>White Tea</li></h3>
            <p>White tea is the most unique tea in Sri Lanka. It’s the also the most expensive, due to how it is harvested. For white tea, only the buds are plucked, and very delicately at dawn. The buds are not fermented at all and are hand rolled individually.</p><p>There is less caffeine and more antioxidants than in green or black tea, making white tea one of the most healthy. White tea is also called “Silver Tips”, and can be found in loose leaf or pyramid bags at all the tea shops in Sri Lanka.</p>
